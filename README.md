# Web-Scraping-Project
## Description
Web scraping is the term for using a program to download and process content from the web. In this repository, i will learn about several modules that make it easy to scrape web pages in Python. This is a simple clone of [**Craigslist**](https://losangeles.craigslist.org) built in Python/Django. In this website u can search everything u had searched on [**Craigslist**](https://losangeles.craigslist.org). The main purpose why i created this website clone was to learn about web scraping and Django. For this project i am using **Django** (Web Frameworks for Python) and built in database(db.sqlite3).
